# AlgorithmicTrading
Summer 2020 algorithm created as a model for predicting bullish markets for a variety of companies, from technology to pharmaceuticals, based off of historical data and technical indicators.

## Technical Indicators

Calculating the Key Performance Indicators (KPIS) using the technical indicators helps assess how a stock is doing compared to predetermined targets or other stocks.

# Volatility
Measures the rate at which the price of value of a security increases or decreases over an interval of returns. In my algorithm, I have used the standard deviation of yearly returns to show the range of the security price over a week.

# Max Drawdown
Measures the maximum price drop of an asset from peak to trough, which helps to measure the risk of investing in a specific security. In my algorithm, I subtract the max drawdown level from a high mark in the returns of a specific ticker and divide the difference by that mark. Analyzing the maximum drawdown requires looking into the maximum percentage drawdown.

# Cummulative Anual Growth Return (CAGR)
Measures the rate of return required for an investment to substantially grow from start to end. Using this indicator requres that profits be fed into the invested stocks at the end of the year in order to measure growth.

# Sharpe's Ratio
Measures the ratio between the mean return of a risk-free rate, or return of an investment with intervalled payments over a given period of time, over the volatility of the investment. Essentially, this helps investors understand the return of an investment given the risk of investing.
